# The Soliloquy of Marc Antony from _Julius Caesar_

O pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers
Thou art the ruin of the noblest man
Who ever lived in the tide of times
Woe to the hands that shed this costly blood
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy
Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips
And beg the voice and utterance of my tongue 
A bunch of bad things will happen in Rome.
Dude, srsly.
Blood and destruction shall be so in use
And dreadful objects so familiar
